## Work/system context (environment isolation)
- Goal/rule: isolate environments: (1) dev, (2) entertainment, (3) company work, (4) personal work.
- Hardware:
  - MacBook M1 2020 (16GB RAM)
  - Mac mini M4 (24GB RAM) — personal
  - Company-provided Windows VM for Remote Desktop
- Work allocation:
  - ~8h/day company work
  - ~3h/night freelance for anh Hiếu; can adjust; commitment stated as ~15h/week (confirm later if needed).
- Account separation needs:
  - Company work: setup git/projects/accounts per Dan’s company info.
  - Work for anh Hiếu: setup git/accounts under anh Hiếu.
- Workflow preference: keep dedicated app windows open per context (e.g., IntelliJ + DataGrip for DB + VS Code for Web UI) and avoid switching workspaces; keep production update environment separated.
- Ongoing: company mobile Flutter project requires releases/updates; plus production deployment environment; plus personal projects.
