- Sent daily backlog snapshot email via Gmail API OAuth.
- Noted that automation scripts should live in OpenClaw workspace (not ad-hoc in ~/dev/google-sheet-exp).
- Created canonical script: `/Users/nqcdan/.openclaw/workspace/automation/gmail/send-backlog-snapshot.mjs` with template + RFC2047 subject encoding.
