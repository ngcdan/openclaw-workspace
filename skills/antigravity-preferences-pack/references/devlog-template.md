# DEVLOG.md template

## Rule
- If `DEVLOG.md` does not exist at repo root, create it.
- Append a short entry for each completed chunk of work.
- Do NOT include a "Files touched" section.

## Entry format
```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - <short title>
- Context: <1 line why>
- Changes:
  - <bullet>
  - <bullet>
- Notes / follow-ups:
  - <optional>
```
