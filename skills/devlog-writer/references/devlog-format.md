# DEVLOG format (Đàn)

## Rule
- If `DEVLOG.md` does not exist at repo root, create it.
- Append one entry per completed chunk of work.
- Do NOT include a "Files touched" section.

## Entry template
```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - <short title>
- Context: <1 line why>
- Changes:
  - <bullet>
  - <bullet>
```

## Style
- Keep entries short, factual, and easy to scan.
- Do not paste long code blocks into DEVLOG.
